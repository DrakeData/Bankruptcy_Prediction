# Bankruptcy Prediction
## Overview
With the ever-changing world that we live in, it is important to understand the factors that go into a potential bankruptcy for a company. Using the [Kaggle Company Bankruptcy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction), we will explore the data, clean up the outliers, and build models to try and predict corporate bankruptcy in the future.

## Notebooks
- [bankruptcy_pred_main.ipynb](https://github.com/DrakeData/Bankruptcy_Prediction/blob/main/bankruptcy_pred_main.ipynb): This is a Colab notebook that will house the code for MSDS 422 Assignment 4 & 5.

## Assignment Overview
- Assignment 4: Loads in the data set, preform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clean up the data, and build models (SVM, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes) to classify and predict corporate bankruptcy.
- Assignment 5: This section picks up were Assignment 4 left off and looks at using Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Extra Trees to try and predict company bankruptcy. We compare the models by looking at their ROC AUC Score, F1-Score, and Accuracy Score.
